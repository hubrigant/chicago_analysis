# Chicago Data Analysis
This project is an effort on my part to learn more about data visualization and machine learning.

I've uploaded all the datasets used uncompressed except for the crime data. That one is bigger than GitHub's 100MB/file limit, so it had to be zipped.

# Dependencies
I make use of the following Python modules:
* geopandas
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* shapely

# Acknowledgements
I've leaned heavily on the following web pages as I've learned to use these tools:
* [The pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/)
* [The shapely documentation](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)
* [matplotlib's API documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html)
* [The wonderful Chicago public data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
* [perrygeo's tutorial on making heatmaps from geopandas DataFrames](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/perrygeo/c426355e40037c452434)
* Many, many, many discussions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* Discussions in the [r/Python](https://reddit.com/r/Python), [r/datascience](https://reddit/r/datascience), and [r/learnpython](https://reddit.com/r/learnpython/) subreddits
